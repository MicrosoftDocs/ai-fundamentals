# Microsoft Learn AI Fundamentals Labs

The sample code in this repository is for use in hands-on exercises in Microsoft Learn modules.

## Setup

The exercises are designed to be completed in Visual Studio Online. To complete the labs, you'll need the following:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
- A Visual Studio Codespace based on the **MicrosoftDocs/ai-fundamentals** code repository. This provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Code, in which you'll be able to run the notebooks for the lab exercises.

To set up a Visual Studio Codespace:

1. Open <a href = "https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?azure-portal=true&name=ai-fundamentals&repo=MicrosoftDocs/ai-fundamentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Online</a> in a new browser tab; and if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Codespaces billing plan, create one. Then create a codespace with the following settings:
    - **Codespace Name**: *A name for your codespace - for example, **ai-fundamentals**.*
    - **Git Repository**: MicrosoftDocs/ai-fundamentals
    - **Instance Type**: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM
    - **Suspend idle Codespace after**: 30 minutes
3. Wait for the codespace to be created. This will take around 3 minutes. You'll see the following things happen:
    - A script will initialize and configure your codespace.
    - A list of notebook (.ipynb) files will appear in the pane on the left.
4. After setup is complete, you can close the **Welcome** and **Creation log** panes. You can also change the color scheme to suit your preference - just click the **&#9881;** icon at the bottom left and select a new **Color Theme**. A light color theme is recommended to make it easier to read the Python code in the notebooks.
