    "# Language Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly, we expect computers to be able to use AI in order to understand spoken or typed commands in natural language. For example, you might want to implement a home automation system that enables you to control devices in your home by using voice commands such as \"switch on the light\" or \"put the fan on\", and have an AI-powered device understand the command and take appropriate action.\n",

    "## Create Authoring and Prediction Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft cognitive services include the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS), which enables you to define *intents* that are applied to *entities* based on *utterances*. You can use either a **Language Understanding** or  **Cognitive Services** resource to *publish* a LUIS app, but you must create a separate **Language Understanding** resource for *authoring* the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), signing in with your Microsoft account.\n",
    "2. Click **+ Create a resource**, and search for *Language Understanding*.\n",
    "3. In the list of services, click **Language Understanding**.\n",
    "4. In the **Language Understanding** blade, click **Create**.\n",
    "5. In the **Create** blade, enter the following details and click **Create**\n",
    "  - **Create option**: Both\n",
    "  - **Name**: *A unique name for your service*\n",
    "  - **Subscription**: *Select your Azure subscription*\n",
    "  - **Resource Group**: *Select an existing resource group or create a new one*\n",
    "  - **Authoring location**: *Select any available location*\n",
    "  - **Authoring pricing tier**: F0\n",
    "  - **Runtime location**: *Same as authoring location*\n",
    "  - **Runtime pricing tier**: F0\n",
    "6. Wait for the resources to be created, and note that two Language Understanding resources are provisioned; one for authoring, and another for prediction. You can view these by navigating to the resource group where you created them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a LUIS App\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement natural language understanding with LUIS, you create an app; and then add entities, intents, and utterances to define the commands you want the app to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a new browser tab, open the LUIS portal at [https://www.luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into LUIS, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details. Then complete the *Welcome* steps by selecting the existing LUIS authoring resource you just created in your Azure subscription. \n",
    "2. Open the **My Apps** page, and select your subscription and LUIS authoring resource. Then create a new app for conversation with the following settings:\n",
    "  - **Name**: Home Automation\n",
    "  - **Culture**: English\n",
    "  - **Description**: Simple home automation\n",
    "  - **Prediction resource**: *Your LUIS prediction resource*\n",
    "3. If a panel with tips for creating an effective LUIS app is displayed, close it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create an Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "An *entity* is a thing that your language model can identify and do something with. In this case, your LUIS app will be used to control various *devices* in the office, such as lights or fans; so you'll create a *device* entity that includes a list of the types of device that you want the app to work with. For each device type, you'll create a sublist that identifies the name of the device (for example *light*) and any synonyms that might be used to refer to this type of device (for example *lamp*).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the LUIS page for your app, in the pane on the left, click **Entities**. Then click **Create**, and create a new entity named **device**, select the **List** type, and click **Next**.\n",
    "2. In the **Create a list entity** page, click *Add new sublist* and type **light**, then press ENTER.\n",
    "3. After the **light** entity has been added, under **Synonyms**, click *Type in value*, and type **lamp** and press ENTER.\n",
    "4. Add a second sublist named **fan** with the synonym **AC**.\n",
    "5. Click **Create** to create the **device** entity with its **light** and **fan** sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An *intent* is an action you want to perform on one or more entities - for example, you might want to switch a light on, or turn a fan off. In this case, you'll define two intents: one to switch a device on, and another to switch a device off. For each intent, you'll specify sample *utterances* that indicate the kind of language used to indicate the intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the pane on the left, click **Intents**. Then click **Create**, and add an intent with the name **switch_on**.\n",
    "2. In the **Utterances** page for the **switch_on** intent, type ***turn the light on*** and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n",
    "3. In the list of utterances, in the *turn the light on* utterance, click the word \"light\", and assign it to the **device** > **light** entity.\n",
    "4. Add a second utterance to the **switch_on** intent, with the phrase ***turn the fan on***. Then assign the word \"fan\" to the **device** > **fan** entity.\n",
    "5. In the pane on the left, click **Intents** and click **Create**, to add a second intent with the name **switch_off**.\n",
    "6. In the **Utterances** page for the **switch_off** intent, add the utterance ***turn the light off*** and assign the word \"light\" to the **device** > **light** entity.\n",
    "7. Add a second utterance to the **switch_off** intent, with the phrase ***turn the fan off***. Then connect the word \"fan\" to the **device** > **fan** entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Test the Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're ready to use the data you've provided in the form of entities, intents, and uterances to train the language model for your LUIS app.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Train** to train the language model\n",
    "2. When the model is trained, click **Test**, and use the Test pane to view the predicted intent for the following phrases:\n",
    "    * *switch the light on*\n",
    "    * *turn off the fan*\n",
    "    * *turn the lamp off*\n",
    "    * *switch on the AC*\n",
    "3. Close the Test pane.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Publish the Model and Configure Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "To use your trained model in a client application, you must publish it as an endpoint to which the client applications can send new utterances; from which intents and entitites will be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Publish**. Then select **Production slot** and click **Done**.\n",
    "2. After the model has been published, at the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Manage**. Then on the **Application Information** tab, note the **Application ID** for your app. Copy this and paste it in the code below to replace **YOUR_LUIS_APP_ID**.\n",
    "3. On the **Azure Resources** tab, note the **Primary key** and **Endpoint URL** for your language model, which is based on your cognitive services resource. Copy these and paste them into the code below, replacing **YOUR_LUIS_KEY** and **YOUR_LUIS_ENDPOINT**.\n",
    "4. Run the cell below by clicking its green <span style=\"color:green\">&#9655</span> button (at the top left of the cell), and when prompted (at the top of this page), enter the text *turn the light on*. The text is interpreted by your LUIS model and an appropriate image is displayed.\n"
