        "# Image Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "The *Computer Vision* cognitive service provides useful pre-built models for working with images, but you'll often need to train your own model for computer vision. For example, suppose the Northwind Traders retail company wants to create an automated checkout system that identifies the grocery items customers want to buy based on an image taken by a camera at the checkout. To do this, you'll need to train a classification model that can classify the images to identify the item being purchased.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Azure, you can use the ***Custom Vision*** cognitive service to train an image classification model based on existing images. There are two elements to creating an image classification solution. First, you must train a model to recognize different classes using existing images. Then, when the model is trained you must publish it as a service that can be consumed by applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Create a Custom Vision resource\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the Custom Vision service, you need an Azure resource that you can use to *train* a model, and a resource with which you can *publish* it for applications to use. The resource for either (or both) tasks can be a general **Cognitive Services** resource, or a specific **Custom Vision** resource. You can use the same Cognitive Services resource for each of these tasks, or you can use different resources (in the same region) for each task to manage costs separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the following instructions to create a new **Custom Vision** resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In a new browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n",
        "2. Select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *custom vision*, and create a **Custom Vision** resource with the following settings:\n",
        "    - **Create options**: Both\n",
        "    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*\n",
        "    - **Resource group**: *Create a new resource group with a unique name*\n",
        "    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*\n",
        "    - **Training location**: *Choose any available region*\n",
        "    - **Training pricing tier**: F0\n",
        "    - **Prediction location**: *The same region as the training resource*\n",
        "    - **Prediction pricing tier**: F0\n",
        "\n",
        "    > **Note**: If you already have an F0 custom vision service in your subscription, select **S0** for this one.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Wait for the resources to be created, and note that two Custom Vision resources are provisioned; one for training, an another for prediction. You can view these by navigating to the resource group where you created them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Create a Custom Vision project\n",
        "\n",
        "To train an object detection model, you need to create a Custom Vision project based on your training resource. To do this, you'll use the Custom Vision portal.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Download and extract the training images from https://aka.ms/fruit-images.\n",
        "2. In another browser tab, open the Custom Vision portal at [https://customvision.ai](https://customvision.ai). If prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription and agree to the terms of service.\n",
        "3. In the Custom Vision portal, create a new project with the following settings:\n",
        "    - **Name**: Grocery Checkout\n",
        "    - **Description**: Image classification for groceries\n",
        "    - **Resource**: *The Custom Vision resource you created previously*\n",
        "    - **Project Types**: Classification\n",
        "    - **Classification Types**: Multiclass (single tag per image)\n",
        "    - **Domains**: Food\n",
        "4. Click **\\[+\\] Add images**, and select all of the files in the **apple** folder you extracted previously. Then upload the image files, specifying the tag *apple*, like this:\n",
        "    <p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/upload_apples.jpg' alt='Upload apple with apple tag'/></p>\n",
        "5. Repeat the previous step to upload the images in the **banana** folder with the tag *banana*, and the images in the **orange** folder with the tag *orange*.\n",
        "6. Explore the images you have uploaded in the Custom Vision project - there should be 15 images of each class, like this:\n",
        "    <p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/fruit.jpg' alt='Tagged images of fruit - 15 apples, 15 bananas, and 15 oranges'/></p>\n",
        "7. In the Custom Vision project, above the images, click **Train** to train a classification model using the tagged images. Select the **Quick Training** option, and then wait for the training iteration to complete (this may take a minute or so).\n",
        "8. When the model iteration has been trained, review the *Precision*, *Recall*, and *AP* performance metrics - these measure the prediction accuracy of the classification model, and should all be high.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Test the model\n",
        "\n",
        "Before publishing this iteration of the model for applications to use, you should test it.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Above the performance metrics, click **Quick Test**.\n",
        "2. In the **Image URL** box, type `https://aka.ms/apple-image` and click &#10132;\n",
        "3. View the predictions returned by your model - the probability score for *apple* should be the highest, like this:\n",
        "    <p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/test-apple.jpg' alt='An image with a class prediction of apple'/></p>\n",
        "4. Close the **Quick Test** window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Publish and consume the image classification model\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you're ready to publish your trained model and use it from a client application.\n",
