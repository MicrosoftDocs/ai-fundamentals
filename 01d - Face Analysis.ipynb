        "# Detecting and Analyzing Faces\n",
        "\n",
        "Computer vision solutions often require an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to be able to detect, analyze, or identify human faces. or example, suppose the retail company Northwind Traders has decided to implement a \"smart store\", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. One way to accomplish this is to perform facial detection and analysis - in other words, determine if there are any faces in the images, and if so analyze their features.\n",
